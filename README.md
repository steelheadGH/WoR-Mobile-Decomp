# WoR-Mobile-Decomp
A decompilation of the game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock Mobile.
# Goal of this project
The goal is to make it easier for enthusiasts to look into the game's java code and mod it.
# Tools used to decompile
The tools I used were:
Apktool
smali2java
# How to use this to mod:
You can simply edit the game's smali files which are available here, compile them into a classes.dex file, and replace the original classes.dex file with your new one.
# What are the .java files alongside the smali files?
They are files that were converted from smali using smali2java. They are probably not perfect.
